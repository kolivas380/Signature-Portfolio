# Signature Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as my signature portfolio, highlighting selected academic and personal projects that demonstrate my growth in software development, data analysis, and machine learning. The projects included represent skills developed through coursework.

## [Personal Portfolio Website](https://github.com/kolivas380/kolivas380.github.io/tree/main)
I chose to highlight my personal portfolio because it was essential for my career search, as it was linked to my LinkedIn profile and resume for recruiters to view. This project taught me more about front-end development while providing a practical resource for job applications. 

## [St. Paul Crime Single Page Web Application](https://github.com/kolivas380/project4-webdev/tree/main)
This project was selected because it combines data analysis, backend development, and frontend visualization into a single web application. By working with real crime data from St. Paul, the project addresses a real-world civic issue and can help the community with meaningful insights.

## [Fake News Detection Project](https://github.com/kolivas380/Machine-Learning-Project/tree/main)
The fake news detection project was chosen during the 2024 Presidential election, when many news articles presented information relating to the presidential candidates. This review examined the 2016 election, but it was interesting to observe the different patterns in which articles with biased or untrue information presented themselves. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to address misinformation and improve public understanding.
